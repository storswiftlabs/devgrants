# Green Grants RFP

## Overview
Filecoin Green is seeking proposals in support of ReFi projects aiming to bring the economic system into a healthier alignment with the natural world. 

We are interested in projects or companies that are working in the ReFi space including, but not limited to those working on reforestation, carbon credits, carbon negative solutions, and biodiversity monitoring and reporting. 

The Filecoin Green mission aims to measure the environmental impacts of Filecoin and verifiably drive them below zero, building infrastructure along the way that allows anyone to make transparent and substantive environmental claims. 

## Project Description
We seek to fund projects that transform financial structures with carbon-neutral, sustainable initiatives. 

These projects are important as we aim to build open-source tools that quantifiably measure and mitigate emissions generated from crypto-related activity.

## Deliverables

Teams should provide a clear outline of the scope of the work, milestones, timeframe, and funding requested. 

Example of Milestones & Funding:
**Total Funding Amount:** List the total proposed funding amount in USD, eventually can be a distribution between USD/FIL
