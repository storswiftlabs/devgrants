# Project Description

With the arrival of the era of multi-chain and the use of smart contracts growing in popularity, the current dApps architecture is obstructing the development of cross-chain dApps. As we all know, dApps in Ethereum can only query the corresponding data through event logs, but event logs have many restrictions: a maximum of 3 indexed parameters and the maximum number of parameters cannot exceed 17, etc. In addition, some other blockchains do not even have the function of event logs like Ethereum provides, so developers can only store some critical data by themselves, mostly in centralized servers through other alternatives.

That's why we come in. The Linkstorage - a unified data storage protocol that provides the ability to enable web3 builders to sync data between blockchains and IPFS/Filecoin through Chainlink External Adapter. The web3 developers can use this protocol to save a massive amount of tamper-proof data onto Filecoin in a cost-effective approach, and the protocol will also provide a unified dashboard for the web3 builders to track and monitor their cross-chain dApps data all in one place in a manageable way.

## Deliverables

1. Chainlink External Adapter to sync data into IPFS/Filecoin with demo

2. Unified dashboard to track and monitor data

## Development Roadmap

Milestone 1 (Week 1 to 5):

- Build a Chainlink external adapter
- Integrate the external adapter with IPFS/Filecoin

Milestone 2 (Week 6 to 8):

- Setup a Chainlink node for testing purpose
- Demo app to show how to use that external adapter

Milestone 3 (Week 9 to 12):

- The external adapter enhancements
- Dashboard development
- Maintenance

## Total Budget Requested

We're a squad of 5 and the total budget for the roadmap is $72,450 for a period of 12 weeks.

- Milestone 1: $31,500

- Milestone 2: $15,750

- Milestone 3: $25,200

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

We're keen to keep maintaining the protocol and making it as a long-term business. Furthermore, we'd like to build a community  and collect feedback and suggestions so as to continuing enhance the product.
