# Open Grants

## About
Do you have an idea for pushing the Filecoin ecosystem forward? Open grants are intended to support novel ideas that advance the Filecoin ecosystem, bring significant new usage, or directly advance the Filecoin mission statement. Proposals should include deliverables, milestones, and funding requests. Deviations from the specified scope of the project must be approved between the team and the Foundation grants team. 

Here are the priority focus areas, but we welcome proposals from all categories.

- **Core development**: With this track, we will fund collaborators with proposals tackling core protocol research, specification, and implementation work. Relevant proposals should be labeled [`category:core-dev`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/labels/category%3Acore-dev).

- **Application development**: We‚Äôre seeking talented application developers to build useful and delightful applications that utilize Filecoin as the decentralized storage layer. Relevant proposals should be labeled [`category:app-dev`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/labels/category%3Aapp-dev).

- **Developer tools and libraries**: We are always looking for proposals for the development of developer tools and libraries for both core protocol developers and application developers. Dev tools at all layers of the stack are invaluable! Relevant proposals should be labeled [`category:devtools-libraries`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/labels/category%3Adevtools-libraries).

- **Integration and adoption**: We are interested in supporting the growth of Filecoin and related technologies via integration into existing app or projects with significant usage. Technical assistance is also available.

- **Technical design**: We want ideas that will improve on the Filecoin protocol technical design, for example improvement proposals on the core storage protocol, cryptoeconomics design, or on other planned network upgrades. Relevant proposals should be labeled [`category:technical-design`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/labels/category%3Atechnical-design).

- **Documentation**: We understand how crucial documentation is for any open-source project and we welcome proposals to create or improve existing Filecoin project documentation. Relevant proposals should be labeled [`category:docs`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/labels/category%3Adocs).

- **Community**: We would like to support community initiatives throughout the global Filecoin ecosystem. We have a standing RFP for hosting community meetups, and are generally excited to hear about all sorts of community initiatives. Relevant proposals should be labeled [`category:community`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/labels/category%3Acommunity).

- **Metaverse**: We are keen to support work to advance interconnectivity, interoperability, and openness at any layer in the growing tide of virtual, immersive worlds (experiences, applications, communities, tooling, standards, infrastructure, et cetera).

- **Research**: We are keen on receiving proposals that explore the meta processes and incentives of decentralized storage. Relevant proposals should be labeled  [`category:research`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/labels/category%3research).

- **Green Grants**: We are interested in proposals for tools, applications, libraries or models for optimizing energy use on the Filecoin network, allowing dApps to assess their environmental impacts, or using Web3 to make reporting more transparent and verifiable. 

## üìã How to apply
                                    
To submit an Open Grant proposal, [create a new issue](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=open-grant-application.md&title=) using the Open Grants Proposal template.
                                                                                                                        
Open Grant proposals are reviewed monthly.                                                          

## ‚åõ After you apply

After you submit your proposal, you can expect the following to occur:

- We will review your application. During review, we will add comments, questions, change requests, et cetera on your team's submission.
- After a few round trips of discussion, our team will make a decision on which proposals to fund and which not to. <!--Accepted proposals will be merged into the appropriate directory, i.e. either [`open-grant`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/tree/master/open-grant) or [`rfp-proposals`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/devgrants/tree/master/rfp-proposals).-->
- During the discussion and review phase, we will contact your team for financial and legal follow-ups, such as to confirm milestones and funding, your team's legal structure, etc.
- If your team is accepted, we will ask you to sign our Open Source Software Grant Agreement, which will include a copy of the work plan and funding milestones. 
- We aim to complete all review within a few weeks after the wave deadline, so please stay vigilant on GitHub.
