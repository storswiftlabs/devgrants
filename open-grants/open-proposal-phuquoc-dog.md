# Open Grant Proposal: `Phu Quoc Dog`

**Name of Project:** Phu Quoc Dog

**Proposal Category:** `app-dev`

**Proposer:** `phuquocdog`

**Do you agree to open source all work you do on behalf of this RFP and dual-license under MIT and APACHE2 licenses?:** Yes

# Project Description

Decentralized dogs social network, it is the best social network for pets, where you can share photos and videos of your pet's life, rescue puppies, adopt a pet, find pet friendly places and take advantage of our useful pet services. Join the moon mission

SHIBA, DOGE just meme token. Phu Quoc Dog is a real coin for real services such as buy food and running a campaign on our platform so you can get more money!!

Phu Quoc Dog is a Substrate-based. Phu Quoc Dog is committed to providing easy-to-use blockchain infrastructure and creating a one-stop comprehensive infrastructure platform, which aims to reduce the threshold and cost for developers, while bringing them great returns.


## Value
Phu Quoc Dog use Filecoin for raw images and blob storage, introducing structured meta-data marketplace protocols to the total number of general users. And use Storage for NFTs

### What are the benefits to getting this right?
The storage space of smart contracts is limited and costly. As the gas limit per block is limited, so is the execution of a transaction, and FileCoin is a decentralized storage network that is frequently cheaper, faster, and more secure than centralized cloud data storage peers such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud.

### What are the risks if you don't get it right?

User may transfer the NFT with the encryption key to other user, which becomes a risk of abusing the system. Also we do not know when a user upload many file to 
own system have effect to Filecoin yet.

### What are the risks that will make executing on this project difficult?

FileCoin has no standard library like aws s3, so it hard to implement and It is difficult to provide highly reliable benchmarks for Filecoin network performance today.

## Deliverables

1. v1 Phu Quoc Dog Blockchain
2. v2 Phu Quoc Dog API
3. v3 Phu Quoc Dog Mobile app

## Development Roadmap

### Architecture

Substrate and Filecoin/S3 are the only required parts of the Phu Quoc Dog protocol.

## Total Budget Requested

* **Total Estimated Duration:** 8 months
* **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  2
* **Total Costs:** $20k for initial grant

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

Our first goal is still to develope a pet social network on a private blockchain platform. It will then integrate the NFT feature for each owner’s animal to be unique on the blockchain network.

And finally we will consider about integrating Defi arrays, integrating support for smart contracts from Ethereum’s ERC20 or Binace’s BEP20 platforms that can run on our blockchain.

We know it will take a long time to complete the above ideas, hope you and investors will join us on this path.
