# Project description
Glitter is an socialized RSS reader based on IPFS&Filecoin, it also provides digital wallet function. Users can post articles/microblog/images/videos on various topics. Users can also subscribe to Twitter/Youtube/Journals through Glitter without complicated switches. All contents on Glitter is provided on IPFS, Glitter will have users content been uploaded to Filecoin network, giving users a more secure and persistent service.

In this way, we are building a synchronized backup bridge between the traditional Internet and the decentralized network using RSS protocol. Even if the original site has been closed, the data of the posts will still be stored in our network in a distributed manner. We believe our platform will be the standard sync protocol of decentralized rss feeds. As more and more users participate, we will store more and more web content data in a distributed manner across the network. Our users will use Glitter RSS as their primary information acquisition and sharing platform.

The desktop version will be a offline workable RSS Client, and if the feed is unaccessable it will try fetch RSS feed via IPFS/Filecoin see if there is anyone storing the content already.

## Value to the Filecoin ecosystem 
Since our goal is to synchronize content from the Internet to the IPFS/Filecoin network via the rss protocol, in this way we will create a backup of a large amount of Internet content in the Filecoin network. In the future, users will be able to access large amounts of Internet data directly through Glitter, while at the same time the Filecoin network will store a direct copy of existing centralized Internet data. And Glitter will be a platform that makes it easier for users to participate in IPFS&Filecoin, making the content creation on IPFS/Filecoin network much easier.
