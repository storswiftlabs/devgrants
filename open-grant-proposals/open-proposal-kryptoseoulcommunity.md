**Proposal Category:** `community`

**Proposer:** `ekang426`

**Do you agree to open source all work you do on behalf of this RFP and dual-license under MIT and APACHE2 licenses?:** Yes, only where relevant since most of the activities are community building 

# Project Description
	
Over the course of 5 months (Aug 2021 - Dec 2021), KryptoSeoul to undertake the following community-building services for the Filecoin Project: 

**1. Community Partner for Filecoin Asia Hackathon Season 2021**

Promote Filecoin Asia Hackathon Season to:
- Korean developer communities 
- Vietnam developer communities
Activities include (but not limited to - up to KryptoSeoul to craft):
- Dissemination of PR, news, updates of the Season to the community
- KryptoSeoul logo to appear as a community partner as well on our PR materials
- Developers can join any track but one way could be to work closely with Tribe to bring developers in the KryptoSeoul community to the Tribe Hackathon 
- Collect feedback from community

**2. Collaboration on other existing hackathons where appropriate**
- KryptoSeoul to see if there are existing hackathons in the schedule where Filecoin can join in, such as ETHVietnam, BUIDL series hackathons and conferences 

**3. Amplification of Filecoin Presence in Korea**
- Help Filecoin on overall brand-building (not day to day operations) in Korea - look to KryptoSeoul to suggest activities here that may be suitable. Some potential activities:
- Interviewing Juan Benet (Founder of Filecoin) on KryptoSeoul YouTube Channel (Erica Show) etc.
- Explore 1-2 meetups in Korea for Filecoin, targeting developers (in Korean), conducted by Korean developer who understands the technicalities
- Encourage developer communities to join our established channels for updates and regular engagement (Filecoin Slack and Telegram once they are set up)
- Loop Filecoin in (where appropriate) into Blockchain or Crypto Summits or Conferences in Korea for speaking engagements 

**4. Introduction to Strategic Partners and Enterprises in Korea** 

Advise Filecoin on potential high leverage collaborations in Korea (and/or Southeast Asia), and make the introduction - such as Kakao (GroundX/Klaytn), LINE, Samsung, LG, universities; other blockchain projects

## Value

Filecoin is trying to grow in Korea in 2021. 
KryptoSeoul will aid in the following goals:
- Grow Filecoin presence in Korea, focusing on the overall brand and visbility
- Engage and onboard more Developers and Filecoin enthusiasts in Korea through KryptoSeoul’s network
- Build 1-2 strategic partnerships with large enterprises in Korea
- Monitor Korean community feedback to advise any next steps required

Potential risks of not getting it right:
- Misinformation via miscommunication between Filecoin and KryptoSeoul, either due to language translations or others, leading to detriment to the brand

Potential risks that will make executing on this project difficult: 
- Sudden tightening of crypto landscape by Korean government (such as restricting activities)

## Deliverables

Listing out a few deliverables as below:
- Successful promotion of asia hackathon season to Korea, direction of korean developers towards tribe hackathon in Singapore
- Filecoin profiled on The Erica Show (either Juan or Colin), with 4.35k YouTube subscribers
- Introduction to 2 potential strategic partners in Korea and help with relationship building 
- At least 1 meetup planned in Korea this year for developers
- 5 monthly recap (or report) of completed activities and feedback from Korean community by KryptoSeoul
