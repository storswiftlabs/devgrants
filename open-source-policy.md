# Open Source Policy for Developer Grants

By default, all grant-funded work must be open sourced under dual [Apache 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) 
and [MIT](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)  for code/software, and all non-code/non-software grant-funded work should be under 
[CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode) licenses. Projects should aim to adopt the open source 
licenses of existing repos to which they are contributing upstream rather than making exceptions. 

## Other Open Source Licenses  

The following open source licenses may be approved on a case-by-case basis.  

- [GNU Lesser General Public License (GNU LGPL)](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/lgpl-3.0/)
- [BSD 2-Clause License](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause)
- [GNU GPL](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/)
- [GNU AGPLv3](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/agpl-3.0/)

## Adoption Funding for Closed Source Projects
In rare cases, we award funding in the **Integration and adoption category** to applications seeking to add 
IPFS, Filecoin, or libp2p support to an existing, closed-source software project. The existing project 
must have significant, industry-leading prior usage. 

If an exception is granted, you must substitute a technical writeup ([example](https://blog.ipfs.io/2021-12-17-omnilingo/)) 
describing your project, integration choices, and IPFS/Filecoin/libp2p usage to serve as a publicly 
available learning resource. A different contract format will be used.


## Permissive License Stack
Please refer to the [Permissive License Stack](https://protocol.ai/blog/announcing-the-permissive-license-stack/) 
for more information about the intellectual property strategies for IPFS, Filecoin, and related projects.

Questions about your projectâ€™s eligibility? You can reach us for additional discussion at grants@filecoin.org 
or on [Slack](https://filecoin.io/slack) at #grants-help.
